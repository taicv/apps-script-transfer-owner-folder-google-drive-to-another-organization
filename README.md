migrateFolderToMIGRATED("https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YlGF8xF8QCbmM20dC62RuXgfLAjQHlQb");
```

### Resume Interrupted Migration

```javascript
// If migration was interrupted, clear the running flag and resume
clearRunningFlag();
migrateFolderToMIGRATED("YOUR_FOLDER_URL");
```

### Start Fresh Migration

```javascript
// Clear all migration data and start over
clearMigrationData();
migrateFolderToMIGRATED("YOUR_FOLDER_URL");
```

### Getting Your Folder URL

1. Open Google Drive in your browser
2. Navigate to the folder you want to migrate
3. Copy the URL from the address bar
4. It should look like: `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/FOLDER_ID`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Key Functions

| Function | Purpose | Usage |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `migrateFolderToMIGRATED()` | Main migration function | Primary function to run |
| `clearRunningFlag()` | Resume interrupted migration | Use when script stops unexpectedly |
| `clearMigrationData()` | Reset all progress | Use to start completely fresh |

### Migration Behavior

- **Same Domain Files**: Moved (preserves ownership)
- **External Domain Files**: Copied (creates new ownership)
- **Shortcuts**: Resolved and actual content is migrated
- **Folder Structure**: Completely preserved

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**üö´ "Migration already running" error**
```javascript
// Solution: Clear the running flag
clearRunningFlag();
```

**üìÅ "Could not extract folder ID from URL" error**
- Ensure you're using the complete Google Drive folder URL
- URL format: `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/FOLDER_ID`

**‚è±Ô∏è Script timeout on large folders**
- The script automatically saves progress and can be resumed
- Run `clearRunningFlag()` then execute the migration function again

**üîí Permission denied errors**
- Ensure you have appropriate access to both source and destination locations
- Some files may require manual sharing from the original owner

### Error Logging

All errors are logged with direct Google Drive links for easy access:
- File errors: Include direct link to the problematic file
- Folder errors: Include direct link to the problematic folder
